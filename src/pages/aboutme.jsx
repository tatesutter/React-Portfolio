        <p>Hey, I'm Tate Sutter, a 21-year-old developer based in Lawrence, Kansas. I'm passionate about building sleek, efficient, and user-friendly web applications using React. Whether it's crafting dynamic front-end experiences or optimizing performance, I love bringing ideas to life through code.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, hitting the gym, or enjoying the outdoors. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges.

Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€</p>
